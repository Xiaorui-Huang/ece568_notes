# ECE568 Computer Security - 2023 Fall

[My Notes for Computer Security Course](https://xiaorui-huang.github.io/ece568_notes/)

## What is Security?

- **Goal vs. Adversary**
  - Objective of security measures against potential threats.

- **Security Policies**
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those
    authorized to have access.
  - **Integrity**: Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data
    over its entire life-cycle.
  - **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information
    and associated resources when required.

## Threat Model

- **Assumptions about the adversary**
  - Understanding what the adversary knows, their capabilities, and intentions.

- **Attacker’s motivation**
  - **Economics**: Profit-driven motives.
  - **Fun & Profit**: Personal gains and amusement.
  - **Vulnerability Marketplace**: Platforms or forums where vulnerabilities are
    sold or discussed.

## Security Mechanism

- **How to help uphold a security policy**
  - **Permission system**: Defines who can access what.
  - **Encryption**: Process of converting information or data into a code to
    prevent unauthorized access.
  - **Hardware protection**: Physical safeguards for data and devices.

- **Security goal vs. Security mechanism**
  - The defined security objectives don't dictate the methods used to achieve
    them.

## Why is Security Hard?

- **Assuming the threat model**
  - Working on real-life scenarios.
  - Adapting to changing environments.

- **Challenges**
  - **Enumerating all possible ways to attack**: Identifying every potential
    vulnerability or threat.
  - **Weakest link matters**: The strength of a system is determined by its most
    vulnerable point.
  - **Hardware changing**: Need to adapt to evolving hardware technologies.
  - **Human errors**: Mistakes made by people that can lead to breaches or
    vulnerabilities.

## What Can We Trust?

- **Trust Issues**
  - **Nothing can be trusted**: Constant skepticism in the security realm.
  - **But we still need to work something out**: Necessity to devise some trust
    model.

- **Assuming TCB: Trusted Computing Base**
  - **The minimal part of the system is not compromised**: Fundamental system
    components that need to be secure.
  - **All secure systems built on top of that**: Building additional layers of
    security based on the TCB.

## Future: Data Privacy

- Data Privacy: Involves the governance of how data is collected, shared, and
  used, ensuring compliance with data protection laws and regulations.
- Data Security: Focuses on protecting data from both internal and external
  threats. Emphasizes on measures taken by organizations to prevent unauthorized
  third-party access.

## Future: Artificial Intelligence

- The concept and scope of AI may undergo changes in terms of adversaries and
  defenders.
- Legal frameworks and regulations may need adjustments to accommodate AI
  advancements.

## Future: Internet of Things (IoT)

- Shortcomings in IoT Systems: They often lack a secure update system, physical
  barriers, privacy protection, and effective network services.
- Other Concerns: Legacy liabilities and components that are either insecure or
  outdated.
- Statistics: Presents the share of security issues among various IoT devices
  with Medical Imaging Systems leading at 51%.

## Future: Cybercrime

- Emphasizes on the prevention of cybercrimes and bolstering security measures.
- Mentions a "Mysterious guest lecturer" in relation to the topic.
